In his presentation, Dr. Wen introduced the latest advances in applying artificial intelligence to materials design, focusing on both small/large atomic models and large language models in materials science. He discussed applications of AI atomic models in defect properties of structural materials like nickel-based and titanium-based alloys, as well as recent work on large foundation atomic models covering 53 elements in the periodic table. Dr. Wen also explored materials-specific large language models developed based on general LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini-Pro, etc.), using prompt engineering techniques for materials property classification and prediction, and leveraging generative models combined with experiments for inverse materials design. The lecture was well-received by researchers and students from the Institute of Physics.",
