            Hello! I&apos;m Tongqi Wen, a lively and driven researcher, passionate about making meaningful contributions to the exciting fields of Artificial Intelligence and Materials Science. Currently, I&apos;m a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). My journey in science has been full of exciting opportunities and collaborations, and I&apos;m always looking forward to the next challenge.

            My research combines machine learning with atomistic simulations to explore fascinating materials, including high-entropy alloys, glass, and defect properties. I&apos;m driven by the belief that technology and innovation can create breakthroughs that shape a brighter future, and I&apos;m always excited to push the boundaries of what we know. Let&apos;s explore, discover, and innovate together!

            Before joining HKU, I had the honor of conducting research at renowned institutions like Ames National Laboratory, Iowa State University (USA), and City University of Hong Kong. Along the way, I was humbled to receive the Ross Coffin Purdy Award from the American Ceramic Society in 2021.
